As a participant, I want to:
* read current proposals DONE!
* add new proposals DONE!
* edit proposals
* vote on proposals
* view total votes on a proposal, if votes are made public
* save my registered name in cookies

As a circle leader, I want to:
* do all the things that participants do
* view total votes on every proposal
* view who voted on what proposal
* remove proposals
